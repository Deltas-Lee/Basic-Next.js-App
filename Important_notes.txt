Caching is storing the result of an expensive operation and returning
        the cached result when the same operation is requested again (it's faster).

3 Data Sources
  - memory
  - file system (fs)
  - network 

  NB: getting data from network is slower than getting data from fs

Next.js comes with its buit-in data cache - automatically store the result in cache,
        based on fs. However this can be disabled using {cache: 'no-store'} or can be controlled
        as to when the app needs to fetch data from fs cache - e.g fetch data every 10 seconds.
